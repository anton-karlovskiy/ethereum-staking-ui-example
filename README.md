## ⚙️ Getting Started  

Install dependencies:  
```bash
yarn install
```

Run the app in development mode:
```bash
yarn start
```

Build for production:
```bash
yarn build
```

## 🎯 Purpose

This staking dApp demonstrates how to combine React, Web3, and modern frontend tooling to build a secure, performant, and user-friendly DeFi application.

It serves both as a real-world integration ([Impermax Finance](https://github.com/Impermax-Finance)) and a reference implementation for future staking platforms.
